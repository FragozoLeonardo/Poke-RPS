# Pokémon RPS

Welcome to PokéRPS, a game of rock-paper-scissors that uses the grass, fire, and water types from the Pokémon games!

The rules of the game are as follows:

- Grass beats Water
- Water beats Fire
- Fire beats Grass

the game is made by Leonardo Quadros Fragozo, but I don't own the Pokémon games, credits to it's owners.
